# **Photo Gallery App (Android)**
Mini Project to test out Material Design concepts and other spikes

### **Proposed features**:
- [x] View a single photo detail -- Used fragment
- [x] Swipe view photo to go to another photo -- used ViewPager
- [x] Use CardView to view the photo
- [x] Use Material Design Bottom Bar Tabs (iOS new look) to switch between view pager and recycler view list and gallery grid mode.
- [x] Fix up Bottom bar tabs so they have icons and are equally distant across the bottom toolbar (still using menu but also used ActionMenuView to hold them)
- [ ] Use RecyclerView to implement Smooth scrolling photo list -- WIP
- [ ] Display photos in a gallery -- Gridview/RecyclerView
- [ ] Able to click on a photo to view
- [ ] Load a set of photos from the phone's gallery or internal database
- [ ] Use floating Action button to add a new photo from the phone's database to the gallery.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**:
- [x] Activity/Fragment
- [x] ViewPager/Adapter
- [ ] Multiple Fragments
- [x] CardView
- [ ] RecyclerView (List) --> Gallery
- [ ] RecyclerView (grid) --> Gallery
- [ ] Toolbar
- [ ] Floating Action Button
